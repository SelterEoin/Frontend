React Context Menu
==================

React Context Menus is a library that aims to simplify the process of getting right click menus into your application. After searching for a long time, I was unsatisfied with the libraries that existed. The aim with this library is to simplify the API while providing control over the functionality and display of the menu to the developer. It is built on top of [Zippy UI react-menus](https://github.com/zippyui/react-menus).
